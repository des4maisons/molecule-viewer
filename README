View a rotating molecule in your terminal! You will need a molecule described
in a .pdb file.

Usage:
python draw_molecule.py pdb-filename [width height]

where width and height are your terminal's width and height, in characters.
If you can choose a font whose height is the same as it's width, it will look
less weird :)
